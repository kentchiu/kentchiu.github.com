##### OOD 五大原則 (5 principles)

SRP
---

Name: The Single Responsibility Principle

Desc: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

OCP
---

Name: The Open Closed Principle

Desc: You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying
it.

LSP
---

Name: The Liskov Substitution Principle

Desc: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

DIP
---

Name: The Dependency Inversion Principle

Desc: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

ISP
---

Name: The Interface Segregation Principle

Desc: Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
