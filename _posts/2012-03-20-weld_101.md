-   @Model = @Named + @RequestScoped
-   The @Named annotation just makes it possible to reference the bean
    from the EL
-   it isn't necessary to create a getter or setter method to inject one
    bean into another. CDI can access an injected field directly (even
    if it's private!)
-   Bean could be invoked by Unified EL.
-   A bean type is a user-defined class or interface.
-   Bean types may be restricted to an explicit set by annotating the
    bean with the @Typed annotation
-   If an injection point does not explicitly specify a qualifier, it
    has the default qualifier, @Default.
-   Don't assign a scope other than @Dependent to an entity class
-   @Produces used in factory method.
-   @Alternative usually used in testing and must be enabled by config
-   

Fixing unsatisfied and ambiguous dependencies
=============================================

#### To fix an unsatisfied dependency, either:

-   create a bean which implements the bean type and has all the
    qualifier types of the injection point,
-   make sure that the bean you already have is in the classpath of the
    module with the injection point, or
-   explicitly enable an @Alternative bean that implements the bean type
    and has the appropriate qualifier types, using beans.xml.

#### To fix an ambiguous dependency, either:

-   introduce a qualifier to distinguish between the two implementations
    of the bean type,
-   disable one of the beans by annotating it @Alternative,
-   move one of the implementations to a module that is not in the
    classpath of the module with the injection point, or
-   disable one of two @Alternative beans that are trying to occupy the
    same space, using beans.xml.
